## About The Project

C# Console Application that manages rental and return processes of different types of vehicles. Currently it works for Cars, Motorcycles and Cargo Vans. The user is not required to enter input, because the input values are part of the code. They can be found in the Main method in <strong>Program.cs</strong>

### Built with

## Structure of the Project

<img alt="car-info" src="https://github.com/SissyManson/Vehicle-Rental-System/assets/44162252/234b05a9-a57f-4050-8928-2fd1136cb36f" width="30%">

<summary>Class Structure</summary>
  <ol>    
    <li><i>Program.cs</i> - the main logic is executed here: creating the instances of the classes.</li>
    <li><i>Vehicle.cs</i> - base class with virtual methods that are shared amongst the derived classes:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Car.cs</i></li>
      <li><i>Motorcycle.cs</i></li>
      <li><i>CargoVan.cs</i></li>
      <p>Each class implements its specific logic for the virtual methods based on certain criteria. For the cars the insurance is reduced if their safety rating is 4 or 5. Additional insurance is calculated if the driver is under the age of 25 and for cargo van drivers the insurance is reduced if their experience is more than 5 years.</p>
      <p>The rent cost is adjusted based on the rental period. Disounts are applied if the vehicle is returned ahead of schedule - the remaining days are 50% off.</p>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>Invoice.cs</i> - contains the logic to calculate the insurance and rental daily and total costs, also the insurance adjusting price.</li>
    <li><i>InvoicePrinter.cs</i> - a dedicated classÂ which holds the code that prints.</li>
  </ol>
